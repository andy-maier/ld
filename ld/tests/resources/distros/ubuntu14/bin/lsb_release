# lsb_release command for testing the ld module.
# Only the -a option is supported.
#
# This version of the lsb_release command reads an lsb-release file.
#
# The lsb-release file has the usual format, e.g.:
#   DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
#   DISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04
#   DISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty
#   DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS"
# Where each line is optional. If a line is missing, the default value
# will be the empty string.
